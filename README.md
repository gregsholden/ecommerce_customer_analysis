# Analysis of transaction data for an online electronics retailer

## Backgound

Uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to analyze transaction data for an online retailer of electronic goods.

The primary goals were to (a) use supervised learning models and a combination of traditional and web-based marketing metrics to predict the likelihood a customer would purchase a specific product, and (2) use unsupervised learning models to create customer clusters that could be used to develop enhanced marketing strategies.

Tradtional marketing metrics included Recency and Frequency of purchases, plus the Monetary Value of purchases made (collectively known as the RFM framework).  Web-based metrics included Length of Browsing Session and the Number of Webpages Visited.

This analysis was part of a Milestone Project for the University of Michigan's Master of Applied Data Science program.
