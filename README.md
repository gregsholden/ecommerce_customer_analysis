# Analysis of transaction data for an online electronics retailer

## Background

Uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to analyze transaction data for an online retailer of electronic goods.

Primary goals were to (a) use supervised learning models and a combination of traditional and web-based marketing metrics to predict the likelihood a customer would purchase a specific product, and (2) use unsupervised learning models to create customer clusters that could be used to develop enhanced marketing strategies.

Tradtional marketing metrics included Recency and Frequency of purchases, plus the Monetary Value of purchases made.  Web-based metrics included Length of Browsing Session and the Number of Webpages Visited.

This analysis was part of a Milestone Project for the University of Michigan's Master of Applied Data Science program.

## Data Source and Description

The data was sourced from this website:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-electronics-store

A sample is also provided in the repository.

The data consists of over 885,000 distinct web-events and 23,000 completed transactions from between October 2019 and February 2020.  It also includes over 53,000 unique product and 700 category codes, which were subsequently consolidated into 103 product groupings and 14 categories during the feature engineering process.
